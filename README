This is a system in development, that will be designed so that a server 
can be hosted on a remote host, and store multiple files. Upon request 
by a client that may connect when it chooses to, it will send the 
requested file to the client, as long as it is stored on the data 
server.

- updated to store connection data from each link temporarily, until the connection is closed
- modular system to allow custom session types (i.e. normal, admin, upload, etc)
